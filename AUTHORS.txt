HHS (Heiko Schulz) started this model originally in 2006, based on the Bocian by AJ MacLeod. 
It received a major update in 2016 by D-ABBA (Thomas Polzer), Viktor Radnai, D-ECHO (Benedikt Wolf) and gsagostinho (Gilberto Agostinho), using parts from the ASK13 by Patrice Poly. 
From this time on it is under active development (see github.com/viktorradnai/flightgear-ask21.git for the development version).
Thanks to Herbert Wagner for various fixes and improvements, including a wind compass, MP fixes and a more realistic stall simulation!
